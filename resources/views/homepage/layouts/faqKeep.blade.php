However, when the payment system is under a heavy load or if there are errors, delays or refund of payments may occur.                                                </p>

                                    I have problems with funds withdrawal. What can I do?                                        </a>

                                                If you have difficulties with withdrawing funds, make sure that: <br>1) There is enough available balance. Sometimes your total account balance can be distributed between the balances of several payment systems. Let's say your actual available balance is 100 USD. When you request a bitcoin withdrawal, but your available bitcoin balance is 60 USD, and the available Perfect Money balance is 40 USD, which means you ought to make 2 requests for Bitcoin and Perfect Money balances independently. <br>2) Your "Withdraw Funds" button is blocked. There may also be some technical problems with the used payment system. If none of this helps, please contact our customer service, which can be contacted in the “SUPPORT” section (a faster way) by creating a ticket directly from your personal account. We will do our best to fix it as soon as possible so that you can get a profit!                                                </p>

                                                    The goal of the affiliate program is to attract as many customers as possible. As a partner, you get a bonus of up to 7% from each deposit of the invited clients to your first line. The more customers you invite, the more deposits they make - the more bonuses you get. To understand that the partner is registered as your referral, we use the referral link. In other words, you must provide potential clients with a referral link so that they can use it to enter the site. If they enter, register and make a deposit, you receive a bonus. Referral link can be distributed personally or via the Internet, on forums, websites, social networks, blogs or instant messengers. You can get a referral link in your account in the "Affiliate Program" section.                                                </p>
